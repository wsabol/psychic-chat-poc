      },
      "accurate-chart": {
        "question": "How accurate is my birth chart?",
        "answer": "The accuracy depends on how precise your birth information is:\n• Accurate birth time (within minutes) = very accurate chart\n• Approximate birth time = reasonably accurate, but some details may vary\n• Birth date only = sun sign and some placements accurate, but rising sign and houses won't be correct\n\nIf possible, get your birth certificate to verify your exact birth time."
      },
      "zodiac-wheel": {
        "question": "What is the Zodiac Wheel and how does it work?",
        "answer": "The Zodiac Wheel is a visual representation of your birth chart showing all 12 zodiac signs arranged in concentric rings. The wheel includes:\n• Sign names and symbols\n• Ruling planets\n• Elements (Fire, Earth, Air, Water)\n• House numbers (I-XII)\n\nThe wheel rotates to position your Rising Sign at the eastern horizon (on the left side). This reflects how you would see the sky at the moment of your birth - looking UP at the celestial sphere rather than DOWN at a map. This is why East appears on the left and West on the right in astronomical charts, creating a mirror image of typical map directions. The horizontal line represents the horizon, with daytime signs above and nighttime signs below."
